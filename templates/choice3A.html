        <p> You stood your ground ; the clown runs towards you, and you let out a punch. To your surprise the clown turns to dust as if it was just an illusion. Knowing you canâ€™t go back at this point you make your way into the final room where standing in front you is a tall man in a black cloak. He begins to congratulate you for getting this far but tells you further resistance is futile.  </p>
